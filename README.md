## 🚀 Overview

This webpage serves as a digital presentation of a brand identity project. Unlike static PDF portfolios, this case study uses **GSAP animations**, **interactive SVGs**, and **responsive grids** to tell the story of how a 10-year incumbent was disrupted through visual strategy.

The layout follows the **40/60 Rule** (40% Text, 60% Visuals), optimized for senior stakeholders who scan rather than read.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Design & Strategy
* **Strategic Layout:** A "Senior Designer" approach with a focus on visual proof over long text.
* **Visual Hierarchy:** Strict typography pairing (Montserrat for headers, Lato for body) to balance highway visibility with hospitality warmth.
* **Data Visualization:** Custom SVG line graphs representing business impact.
* **Smart Image Handling:** All image containers utilize `object-fit: cover` to ensure perfect responsiveness regardless of asset aspect ratio.

### ⚡ Technical Implementation
* **Framework-Free:** Built with pure **HTML5** and **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for instant loading and zero build steps.
* **Advanced Animations (GSAP):**
    * **Scrollytelling:** Elements fade, slide, and scale as the user scrolls.
    * **SVG Morphing:** A custom animation where the logo rotates 45° and transforms into a "Smiley Face" to visualize customer satisfaction.
    * **Live Drawing:** The logo concept draws itself using SVG stroke-dashoffset manipulation.
    * **Infinite Loops:** Key visual concepts play in 3-second loops to keep the user engaged.
* **Responsive Grid:** A mobile-first approach that adapts from single columns to complex 2x2 bento grids on desktop.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Structure:** HTML5
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (CDN)
* **Animation:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) + ScrollTrigger
* **Typography:** Google Fonts (Lato & Montserrat)
* **Graphics:** Inline SVG & MP4 Video Backgrounds
